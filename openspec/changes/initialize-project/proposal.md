# Initialize Project

This proposal outlines the initialization of the Temporal Code City project.
It covers setting up the file structure, installing core dependencies (React, Three.js), and configuring the build system (Vite) and code quality tools.

## Goal

To provide a stable foundation for development with a configured frontend environment.
